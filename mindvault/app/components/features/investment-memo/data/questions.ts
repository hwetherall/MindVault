    question: 'What is the current Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of the company?',
    description: 'Find the most recent ARR figure with currency.',
    category: 'Financial',
    complexity: 'medium',
    recommended: ['excel'],
    instructions: `You are tasked with finding the company's current Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Remember: Any financial figure extracted must be accompanied by the currency as listed in the source. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Search for ARR Data**: Look for any documents or spreadsheets that reference ARR or contain data related to recurring revenue. Common places to check include financial reports, KPI reports, or specific revenue breakdowns. Ensure these documents are NOT forecasted figures. Discard forecasts.\n\n2. **Check for Direct ARR Information**: If the document directly lists ARR, extract that number. ARR is often presented as a top-level metric in financial statements, quarterly reports, or revenue charts.\n\n3. **If ARR Is Not Explicitly Listed**: If the document does not provide ARR directly, look for the **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** or any similar figures. ARR can be calculated by multiplying MRR by 12 (i.e., ARR = MRR \u00d7 12). Ensure you verify that the MRR provided is related to recurring revenue (i.e., not one-time payments).\n\n4. **Look for the Most Recent Figures**: Always make sure that you are referencing the most recent data available. If there are multiple versions of the report or data spread across different periods, prioritize the most recent one. For example, if there are figures for previous quarters or fiscal years, extract the most up-to-date ARR value.\n\n5. **Verify Source**: If you find the ARR figure in a specific tab, such as \u201cARR Info\u201d ensure you extract it from the correct place. Double-check that the value you find is for the correct period (e.g., current fiscal year or quarter).\n\n6. **Provide the Current ARR**: Once the ARR is found or calculated, provide the exact value. If there are any specific currencies mentioned (e.g., AUD, USD), include that in the answer. For example, \"The current ARR is $100m AUD.\"\n\n### Tips:\n- If working with multiple sources or documents, make sure to cross-check the ARR data to ensure consistency.\n- Pay attention to the time frame mentioned in the document to ensure the ARR is current and relevant.\n- Keep the answer precise and in the correct format (i.e., the numerical value followed by the currency).`

    description: 'Calculate the YoY growth percentage from the latest financial data.',
    category: 'Financial',
    complexity: 'medium',
    recommended: ['excel'],
    instructions: `You are tasked with determining the company's Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rate. Remember: Any financial figure extracted must be accompanied by the percentage sign and time period. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Search for Growth Rate Data**: Look for any documents or spreadsheets that contain data related to the company's growth metrics. This could include financial statements, investor presentations, or specific growth metrics summaries. Focus on finding year-over-year comparisons.\n\n2. **Identify Key Growth Metrics**: Look for growth rates for important metrics such as:\n   - Revenue growth (most common and important)\n   - Customer growth\n   - ARR/MRR growth\n   - Market share growth\n\n3. **Find the Most Recent Growth Figures**: Always prioritize the most recent growth data. If there are multiple periods shown, focus on the latest complete year-over-year comparison.\n\n4. **Calculate Growth Rate If Needed**: If the growth rate isn't explicitly stated but you have values for two comparable periods, calculate it using this formula:\n   Growth Rate = (Current Period Value - Previous Period Value) / Previous Period Value ร 100%\n\n5. **Verify Time Periods**: Ensure you're comparing the same time periods (e.g., Q1 2023 vs. Q1 2022, or FY2023 vs. FY2022).\n\n6. **Provide the Growth Rate**: Once you've found or calculated the growth rate, provide the exact percentage with the appropriate time period reference. For example, "The YoY revenue growth rate is 37% (FY2023 vs. FY2022)."\n\n### Tips:\n- If multiple growth metrics are available, prioritize revenue growth as the primary metric, but mention other important growth indicators as well.\n- Be specific about which metric the growth rate applies to (revenue, customers, etc.).\n- If there are significant differences in growth rates across different periods, mention this trend.`

    question: 'What is the target valuation for the company?',
    description: 'Identify the valuation the company is seeking in this funding round.',
    category: 'Financial',
    complexity: 'medium',
    recommended: ['pdf'],
    instructions: `You are tasked with identifying the target valuation for the company in its current or upcoming funding round. Remember: Any financial figure extracted must be accompanied by the currency as listed in the source. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Search for Valuation Information**: Look for any documents that mention valuation, particularly in pitch decks, investor presentations, term sheets, or funding-related sections. Key terms to look for include "valuation," "pre-money," "post-money," "company value," or specific funding round details (e.g., "Series A at $X valuation").\n\n2. **Distinguish Between Pre-Money and Post-Money Valuation**: If both are mentioned, note the difference:\n   - **Pre-money valuation**: The company's value before receiving new investment\n   - **Post-money valuation**: The company's value after receiving new investment (Pre-money + new investment amount)\n\n3. **Identify the Current Funding Round**: Determine which funding round the company is currently seeking (Seed, Series A, B, C, etc.) and the associated valuation target for that specific round.\n\n4. **Look for Valuation Ranges**: Sometimes companies provide a range rather than a specific figure. If so, include both the lower and upper bounds of the target valuation.\n\n5. **Check for Valuation Multiples**: Some documents might mention valuation in terms of multiples (e.g., "seeking 10x revenue valuation"). If revenue figures are available, calculate the implied valuation.\n\n6. **Provide the Target Valuation**: Once you've found the valuation information, provide the exact figure with the appropriate currency. Specify whether it's pre-money or post-money if that information is available. For example, "The company is seeking a pre-money valuation of $50M USD in their Series B round."\n\n### Tips:\n- Pay attention to the context around valuation figures to ensure you're reporting the target valuation (what they're seeking), not historical valuations from previous rounds.\n- If multiple valuation figures appear in different documents, prioritize the most recent information.\n- If no explicit valuation is stated but there are details about investment amount and equity percentage, you can calculate the implied post-money valuation (Investment Amount รท Equity Percentage = Post-Money Valuation).`
