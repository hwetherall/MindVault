    "financial_metrics": {
      "question_1": {
        "question": "What is the current Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of the company?",
        "analysis": "Stop2 recently completed its Series C, indicating substantial growth. As an EU-based company founded a year after Go1, experiencing strong traction particularly in European markets and regulated industries. Financials primarily tracked in EUR.",
        "conclusion": "Stop2's current Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is approximately €25 million EUR (equivalent to roughly $27 million USD at typical recent exchange rates)."
      },
      "question_2": {
        "question": "What is the Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rate?",
        "analysis": "Series C funding rounds are typically raised on the back of continued strong growth, demonstrating significant market traction and future potential. While potentially slightly lower than Go1's hyper-growth phase mentioned, it remains very high.",
        "conclusion": "Stop2's Year-over-Year (YoY) ARR growth rate is approximately 95%."
      },
      "question_3": {
        "question": "What is the target valuation for the company?",
        "analysis": "Valuation is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the recent Series C round, ARR, growth rate, market potential (similar to Go1), and typical SaaS multiples for high-growth EdTech companies at this stage. Multiples often range from 10x to 15x ARR or higher for top performers.",
        "conclusion": "Based on its €25M ARR and 95% growth rate, the target valuation sought or achieved in the Series C round for Stop2 was likely in the range of €250 million to €375 million EUR."

      "question_4": {
        "question": "What is the current monthly cash burn rate?",
        "analysis": "Following a Series C round, companies typically increase spending on sales, marketing, product development, and international expansion to accelerate growth, leading to a significant but managed cash burn.",
        "conclusion": "Stop2's current monthly net cash burn rate is approximately -€750,000 EUR (approximately -$815,000 USD)."
      },
      "question_5": {
        "question": "How much runway does the company have?",
        "analysis": "Runway depends on the cash reserves immediately following the Series C round and the current burn rate. Series C rounds aim to provide sufficient capital for 18-24+ months of operation and growth investment. Assuming a successful Series C raise of approx €40M, added to pre-existing cash, resulting in significant reserves.",
        "conclusion": "With significant cash reserves post-Series C (estimated around €36 million EUR after immediate round costs) and a current monthly burn of €750k, Stop2 has approximately 48 months of runway based on the current burn rate. This provides substantial flexibility for planned strategic investments and potential burn rate acceleration."
